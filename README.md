# KU-CS-Compeition
We have made a variant a Tic-Tac-Toe called Achi using the Python console.

**Achi Rules**:
 - Player: The game has two players. We refer to them as Player 1 and Playter -1.
 - Setup: The game is played on a 3x3 grid of square dots, or numbers. Our game uses -1, 0, and 1 in a 3x3 matrix.
 - Notation: Similar to a chess board\
   [A3, B3, C3]\
   [A2, B2, C2]\
   [A1, B1, C1]
 - Stage 1: The game is played like regular tic-tac-toe, alternating turns of placing 1s and -1s trying to get 3 in a row. This stage goes on until either somoeone wins (the game will not go on to Stage 2) or 8 boxes are occupied (only of the boxes is a 0). 
 - Stage 2: This is the sliding stage. Players take turns sliding an integer of theirs along a connecting edge into the space left empty. The winner is the first player to get 3-in-a-row.\

The image below shows which dots are connected to each other.\
