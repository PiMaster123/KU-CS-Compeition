# KU-CS-Compeition
We have made a variant a Tic-Tac-Toe called Achi using the Python console.

**Achi Rules**:
 - Player: The game has two players. We refer to them as Player 1 and Playter -1.
 - Setup: The game is played on a 3x3 grid of square dots, or numbers. Our game uses -1, 0, and 1 in a 3x3 matrix.
 - Notation: Similar to a chess board\
   A3, B3, C3\
   A2, B2, C2\
   A1, B1, C1\
 - Stage 1: The game is played like regular tic-tac-toe, alternating turns of placing 1s and -1s trying to get 3 in a row. This stage goes on until either somoeone wins or 8 boxes are occupied.
